# Traveling Salesman GUI

A visual tool for exploring the Traveling Salesman Problem, developed in 2019 as part of . I created the graphics from scratch without using any external packages, relying solely on Swift for the design of the JFrame. The comments in the code are in German.

## Motivation

Understanding theoretical algorithms can be challenging for beginners, especially when they are abstract and hard to visualize. To address this, I developed the Traveling Salesman GUI, a tool that allows users to create their own graphs and observe the TSP algorithm in action step by step. This hands-on approach aims to demystify the algorithm and make it more accessible and engaging.

## Features

This tool provides a comprehensive and interactive way to understand the Traveling Salesman Problem. Here are some of the key features:

1. **Showcase Algorithm**: Users can observe the TSP algorithm in action, with options to set the interval between steps or manually click through each step to see the process unfold.

2. **Modifying Graph**: The tool allows for full customization of the graph, including:
   - **Adding, Editing, and Deleting Nodes**: Create and modify the nodes that represent cities or stops.
   - **Shortcuts for Deleting All Edges or Nodes**: Quickly reset your graph to experiment with different configurations.

3. **Visual Customization**: Users can set a variety of visual parameters to tailor the appearance of the graph:
   - **Color of Nodes**: Adjust colors based on certain condition.
   - **Size of Nodes**: Change the size of nodes for better visibility or emphasis.
   - **Color of Edges**: Customize the color of the connections (edges) between nodes.
   - **Color of Weights**: Set colors for the weights of edges to distinguish between different routes or distances.
